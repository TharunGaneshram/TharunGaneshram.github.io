            <p>This project features a <strong>robotic hand</strong> controlled by five <strong>stepper motors</strong>, each corresponding to a finger, with input from an object detection system powered by <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. The <strong>STM32</strong> microcontroller handles the motor control, while the <strong>ESP32</strong> manages Bluetooth communication with a laptop running the object detection model on <strong> OpenCV </strong> webcam input. CAD software was used to design the robotic hand components, which were then 3D printed. The project merges several technologies, from real-time motor control using <strong>PWM</strong> and <strong>UART communication</strong>, to machine learning for gesture detection and mimicry. This unique combination of mechanical design, embedded systems, and machine learning provided a comprehensive learning experience, emphasizing how multiple domains interact to create complex, responsive systems.</p>

            <p>As part of the Waterloo Hyperloop design team, I re-architected their entire firmware system using <strong>FreeRTOS</strong> and the <strong>CMSIS-RTOS2</strong> API. Using FreeRTOS as an environment for managing multiple tasks concurrently on the <strong>STM32</strong> microcontrollers, I implemented the RTOS for three critical modules: Sensor Module, Motor Controller Module, and Battery Management System (BMS). The <strong>Sensor Module</strong> handled data from pressure sensors, IMUs, and MUXes with dedicated threads and sent this data to the Raspberry Pi through CAN. The <strong>Motor Controller Module</strong> included FIFO management and tasks for processing motor commands, speed control, and emergency functions, with a CAN thread for data handling. The <strong>BMS</strong> module monitored battery metrics, utilized PWM for cell balancing, and polled thermistors for multi-fan thermal control. This project showcased my ability to integrate RTOS functionalities into complex embedded systems, enhancing real-time task management and system efficiency.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Omni-Directional Bluetooth Car</strong> project was designed to explore real-time vehicle control using Bluetooth communication. The car features one powered pivot wheel and three support pivot wheels, controlled using an <strong>ESP32</strong> for Bluetooth communication and an <strong>STM32</strong> microcontroller for vehicle control. Input data is transferred over <strong>UART</strong>, split into speed and direction values, and used to adjust <strong>PWM signals</strong> for dynamic motion control. This project gave me hands-on experience with wireless communication, real-time control in embedded systems, and the effective use of PWM for motor control. Additionally, this project allowed me to play around with SolidWorks as well as see the end-to-end hardware-software integration of a system that reacts to external commands in real-time.</p>

The project involved decoding DroneCAN messages, specifically extracting servo commands and converting them to <strong>PWM</strong> signals for motor control. By establishing this integration, I successfully controlled four servo motors, improving the droneâ€™s <strong>balancing, control, and maneuverability</strong>. Extensive debugging and testing were crucial to ensure reliable communication between the Pixhawk and STM32, eliminating signal noise with differential communication. This project expanded my expertise in working with a largely abstracted real-time embedded system, efficient data handling, and precise motor control, providing a robust solution for drone signal transmission.</p>

The system uses servo motors for axis and gripper control, enabling smooth and precise movement of payloads. The firmware developed incorporates direct manipulation of servos through <strong>digital pins</strong>, which communicate serially with an external controller. This project helped build my foundation in motor control in embedded systems, where precise timing and smooth transitions between positions are crucial. Writing firmware for servo control and implementing a basic <strong>serial communication protocol</strong> showed me how embedded systems handle real-world mechanical tasks, such as automated manufacturing or robotics.</p>

            <p>This <strong>4D Chess Game</strong> project was a venture into the complexities of multidimensional board games, implemented in both <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>. The project focused on creating a 4-dimensional chessboard, with individual chess pieces coded as separate classes, each inheriting from a base <strong>ChessPiece</strong> class. It helped me build skills in managing polymorphic behavior for chess piece movements and implementing game logic for checking and checkmating conditions. Working with complex multidimensional arrays and classes helped solidify my understanding of memory management and efficient data structures. This project showed me how <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> can be applied to manage complex logic in a structured and reusable way.</p>
